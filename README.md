This changes intend to provide laser orientation for FabScanPi 
To do so is necessary to give dir_ini parameter in laser section of default.config.json file in /etc/fabscanpi directory
This parameter is read by the modified FSSerial.py file in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/FabScanPi-0.4.3-py2.7.egg/fabscan/scanner/laserscanner
Then the value provided is communicated to arduino througt G5 funcion implemented in firmware v.20170726.hex that has to be put in
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/FabScanPi-0.4.3-py2.7.egg/fabscan/firmware directory

The config file provided refers to my testing device i.e. an Arduino UNO attached to the USB0 port. If using HAT is not necessary flash?baudrate parameter in serial seccion and you have to put AMA0 port instead of USB0 port
